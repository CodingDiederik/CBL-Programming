Create classes:
- main class: Game -> only one instance
- player class -> one instance
- class level -> later: make it a superclass of classes level1, level2, etc.
    - in constructor fill the level with the desired obstacles.
- Obstacles class: superclass of all obstacles we want to implement.

In case of moving enemy's: enemy class 

KeyEvent detection:
The Game class will be it's own keyListener.
It calls the correct method on player to update it's coordinates

Rendering the level:
frame.add(level): in level we override the paintComponent method to draw the level.
To be able to draw the player give the created player instance made in te Game class as parameter when creating the level.

PlayerMovement:
Use a physicsmodel with accelaration, gravity etc.
Determine te position of the player from it's center.

CollisionDetection:
