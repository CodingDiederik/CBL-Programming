Create classes:
- main class: Game -> only one instance
- player class -> one instance
- class level -> later: make it a superclass of classes level1, level2, etc.
    - in constructor fill the level with the desired obstacles.
- Obstacles class: superclass of all obstacles we want to implement.

In case of moving enemy's: enemy class 

KeyEvent detection:
A Listener class is created and makes calls when certain keys are pressed.

Rendering the level:
frame.add(level): in level we override the paintComponent method to draw the level.
To be able to draw the player give the created player instance made in te Game class as parameter when creating the level.

PlayerMovement:
Use a physicsmodel with accelaration, gravity etc.
Determine te position of the player from it's center.

We use a timer that refreshes the screen every 120 frames per second.

CollisionDetection:

This is how it works:
    - It gets the level list and the direction the player wants to move to
    - TODO
